# VSDI Web Services Life Cycle Support Policy
Updated August 19, 2025

## Purpose
This Life Cycle Support Policy is designed to help communicate how VCGI manages web services over their life span.

## Scope
Vermont Spatial Data Infrastructure (VSDI) web services hosted by VCGI using ArcGIS Server (AGS) and ArcGIS Online (AGO) platforms.

## Policies
### Support Hours
Support hours are from 7:45 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday.  No weekends.  No Holidays.

### Service Ability
VCGI strives to meet the following service availability standards.

| Availability   | % Downtime per year  | Downtime per month  | Downtime per week  |
|----------------|----------------------|---------------------|--------------------|
| 98%            | 7.30 days            | 14.4 hours          | 3.36 hours         |

### Routine Maintenance Notification
VCGI will avoid conducting routine maintenance during core hours and days (7:45 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday).  Notice will only be given for planned disruptions greater than 1 hour. Notices will be sent out on the VGIS-L listserv. Sign up/login to VGIS-L is [here.](https://list.uvm.edu/cgi-bin/wa?SUBED1=vgis-l&A=1)

### Removal of Services
VCGI will give 30 days’ notice prior to the removal of a service. Notices will be sent out on the VGIS-L listserv prior to such changes. Thus, users and application developers should subscribe to the VGIS-L listserv.

### Modifications to Services
VCGI assigns version numbers to its services (except those “grand-parented” without a version number).  The 1st release of a service is tagged as “v1”, with any subsequent versions incremented by 1 (eg: v2) when “substantive changes” are made. The previous version will then be removed per the “Removal of Services” policy above.

### Substantive Changes
Removal of objects (feature classes, tables, rasters, relationships) and/or fields associated with these objects from an AGS/AGO Service (including geocoding services). Adding fields to an object DOES NOT constitute a substantive change. Data edits to features or attributes DO NOT constitute a substantive change.

## Services Registry
All web services where Host Organization = VCGI in this VSDI Web Services Matrix are supported under this Life Cycle Policy.  All other web services in the table not hosted by VCGI or those discovered by users on VCGI’s ArcGIS Online or ArcGIS Server instance are NOT supported by this policy and therefore can be removed without warning.
