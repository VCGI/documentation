  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>COVERAGE</td>
    <td>A digital analog of a single map sheet forming the basic unit of data storage. In a coverage, map features are stored as primary features, such as arcs, nodes, polygons, and label points, and secondary features, such as tics, extent, and annotation. Map feature attributes are described and stored independently in feature attribute tables. 2. A set of thematically associated data considered to be a unit. A coverage usually represents a single them or layer, such as soils, streams, roads, and land use.</td>

    <td>CPU</td>
    <td>See CENTRAL PROCESSING UNIT</td>

    <td>DANGLING NODE</td>
    <td>The 'dangling' endpoint of a dangling arc. Usually identifies that a polygon does not close properly (undershoot), that arcs do not connect properly, or that an arc was digitized past its intersection with another arc (overshoot). In some cases, a dangling node may be acceptable. For example, in a street centerline map, cul-de-sacs are often represented by dangling arcs.</td>
